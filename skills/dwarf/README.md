## How to use

- Read the `SKILL.md` of a skill for its triggers, reasoning rules, and verification commands.
  (`references/` hold deep knowledge; `examples/good` and `examples/bad` are compiled/run
  fixtures; `evals/README.md` defines eval cases.)
- Load only the skill you need (see `skills/_meta/meta-routing`; references load on demand.
