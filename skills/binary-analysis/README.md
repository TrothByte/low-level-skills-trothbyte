# binary-analysis — Skills

Reading binaries means recovering what the compiler encoded. This skill teaches type recovery from disassembly — pointer vs integer, struct offsets, function signatures.

## Skills in this domain

| Skill | What it does | Stability | Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| `binary-analysis-type-recovery` | Use when recovering C types (char, short, int, long, float, double, structs, arrays, pointers, function/vtable signatures) from x86-64 disassembly via instruction-width and addressing patterns (movzx/movsx, movss/movsd, movl/movq, disp(%reg), scale indexing), validated with DWARF when present. | source-backed | `skills/binary-analysis/binary-analysis-type-recovery` |

## How to use

- Read the `SKILL.md` of a skill for its triggers, reasoning rules, and verification commands.
- `references/` hold the deep knowledge; `examples/good|bad` are verified compile-and-run fixtures;
  `evals/` define how the skill is tested.
- Load only the skill you need (see `skills/_meta/meta-routing`); references load on demand.
